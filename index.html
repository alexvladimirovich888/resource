      <p class="subtitle">Own. Keep. Grow.</p>
      <p class="intro">
        A meditation on value — on what it means to possess, to preserve, and to let what you hold quietly return to you.  
        RESOURCE is not a currency, but a concept: a reflection on care, balance, and time.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Everything we touch, we alter. Everything we keep, we shape.  
        RESOURCE began as a question: what does it mean to own something without consuming it?  
        The answer is not in markets, but in mindfulness — in learning to see holding as an act of creation.

      <h2>Meaning</h2>
      <p>
        To hold is to pause. To pause is to see.  
        In a world that accelerates endlessly, the rarest resource is stillness itself.  
        What we choose to sustain defines who we become.
      </p>

    <section class="section fade" id="practice">
      <h2>Practice</h2>
      <p>
        RESOURCE invites you to practice keeping — to nurture rather than exploit, to notice rather than acquire.  
        When attention becomes continuity, growth ceases to be a chase and becomes a rhythm.
      </p>

    <section class="section fade" id="reflection">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Consider your own resources — time, care, energy, presence.  
        They are finite, but within them lies infinite potential.  
        How you hold them determines how they hold you.
